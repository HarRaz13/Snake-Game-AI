## Installation

The device you need to run this project must have Python installed and one must use some sort of IDE to interface with the source code.
IDE used is Pycharm.

The major libraries used in these are:
  1. [Pytorch - Version 2.0.1]
  2. [Pygame - Version 2.5.2]


## Usage

To observe the functionality of the project, follow these steps:

1. Begin by installing or importing the project into an IDE with Python support.
2. Ensure that all necessary libraries are included to avoid any potential errors.
3. Simply execute the `agent.py` file to initiate the project's operations.
   
## Features

Feauters of this project are as follows:
1. I have used Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q Neural Network for the training of the agent which enables it to autonomously comprehend its environment and objectives without external assistance.
2. We have used 
3. I have also incorporated a progress graph illustrating the performance of the agent throughout a gaming session. This graph offers insights into how the agent learns to navigate the game and devise its own strategies.
